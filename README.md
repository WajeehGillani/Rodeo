# Features

After launching it for the first time and authenticating with your wallet, Rodeo fetches all of the pictures and various metadata for the collection of NFTs stored in it.

## Quick setup

Rodeo uses WalletConnect to quickly fetch data for all of the assets stored in the authenticated wallet. Note: we only link to those assets and do not in any way interact with them such that they could become lost, traded, stolen, etc.

## Pick & choose what you want to display

Once a wallet is set up, you can choose which assets to displayâ€”by default Token Rodeo will display all of them.

## Custom themes (COMING SOON)

After picking which assets you want to display in your gallery, you can choose a theme that best showcases your work. You'll be set up with our default initially, but there will be more themes to choose from in the future.

## Lightning fast static site

With assets and a theme selected, Rodeo will generate your custom static site which can be quickly deployed on a hosting service of your choosing (our pick for this is Netlify). It's all compiled with the Eleventy static site generator and is designed for a super clean and fast experience for your viewers.
